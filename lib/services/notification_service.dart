// services/notification_service.dart
//
// Read and mark-read access to `notifications`, plus its realtime subscription.
//
// A DIRECT PORT OF `hooks/useNotifications.ts`
// -------------------------------------------
// Query for query: `.eq('user_id')`, `.order('created_at', desc)`, `.limit(50)`
// (`:29-33`); mark-read by id (`:50-53`); mark-unread by id (`:70-73`); mark-all by
// `user_id` + `is_read = false` (`:88-92`).
//
// NOTHING HERE WRITES A NOTIFICATION
// ----------------------------------
// The portal's hook also exposes `createNotification`. This service deliberately
// does not: five services in this app already insert rows
// (`project_share_service`, `profile_connection_service` ×2, `builder_sections_service`,
// `broker_sections_service`), each with its own copy and payload, and Spec G is
// under instruction not to modify them. A sixth writer here would be a second way
// to do something already done five times.
//
// AND NOTHING HERE SENDS PUSH
// ---------------------------
// It must not. `notifications` has an AFTER INSERT trigger that posts every row to
// the `send-web-push` edge function (20270203000000_web_push_on_notification_insert),
// so delivery is automatic and server-side. `notificationHelpers.ts:48` records that
// calling the function *and* inserting double-sends. The five existing writers
// therefore already reach the recipient's browser today with no client work.
//
// NO BACKEND CHANGE
// -----------------
// Three SELECTs and three UPDATEs, all permitted by the table's existing RLS
// (`auth.uid() = user_id` for both), plus a subscription to a table already in the
// `supabase_realtime` publication with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.
