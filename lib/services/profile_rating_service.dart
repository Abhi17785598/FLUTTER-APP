// services/profile_rating_service.dart
//
// Writing a rating: submit, update, and read back the viewer's own.
//
// A COMPANION, NOT AN EXTENSION OF RatingsService
// -----------------------------------------------
// `RatingsService.getRatingSummary()` is consumed by `ProfileProvider` for the
// own-profile Reviews tile. It is read-only, unmodified, and stays that way — the
// same choice Phase 1 made when `ProfileContentService` took on the public
// profile's rating read rather than extending it.
//
// Reads live elsewhere by design: `ProfileContentService.fetchRatings` already
// folds every aggregate the Reviews section needs out of one query. The only read
// here is [fetchMyRating], because "has the viewer already rated?" is a
// write-path question — it decides between an insert and an update.
//
// RLS, VERIFIED — no backend change is needed:
//   INSERT  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = rater_id AND auth.uid() <> rated_user_id)
//   UPDATE  USING      (auth.uid() = rater_id)
//   SELECT  USING      (true)
// (20251207160017_*.sql, tightened by 20260710123600_audit_optimize_rls_initplan.sql)
//
// So the database already refuses a self-rating and already refuses editing
// someone else's. The guards below exist to avoid a pointless round-trip and to
// produce a sensible message, not to provide the security.
