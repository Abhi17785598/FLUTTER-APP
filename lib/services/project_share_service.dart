// services/project_share_service.dart
//
// "Share project" — notifies a builder's accepted network connections that a
// project has been published.
//
// A COMPANION, BY NECESSITY
// -------------------------
// `NetworkService` declares itself read-only in its own header — *"Every method
// is a `select`"* — and lists the network writes that stay with the web portal.
// Adding an insert there would falsify that contract. Its `listMemberships` is
// also the wrong shape for this: it does **not** filter `status`, so reusing it
// would notify pending and rejected connections too.
//
// WHAT IT PORTS
// -------------
// `BuilderProjectsManager.tsx:308-380` (`handleShareProject`) plus
// `utils/notificationHelpers.ts:174-187` (`notifyProjectShared`):
//
//   1. read the builder's company/display name for the message;
//   2. select `builder_networks` where `builder_id = me OR member_id = me` **and**
//      `status = 'accepted'`;
//   3. for each row take the *other* party — a builder can appear on either side;
//   4. dedupe, because two rows can name the same counterpart;
//   5. one `notifications` row each.
//
// `notifications` INSERT is `TO authenticated WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT
// NULL)`, so writing a row addressed to someone else is permitted — which is what
// makes this fan-out possible at all.
