//
// The single writer for the Edit Profile screen.
//
// DELEGATES, DOES NOT DUPLICATE
// ----------------------------
// `AuthService.updateProfileFields()` is the app's established `profiles` writer
// and is what `ProfileService` and the registration wizards already use. This
// service builds the payload and hands it over; it never issues its own
// `.update()`. A second writer would be a second place for the merge rules below
// to drift.
//
// THREE RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE
// ---------------------------------------
// 1. `social_media` is MERGED, never replaced. The column holds ~35 keys written
//    by four different flows (three registration wizards and the portal's edit
//    form). Sending a fresh object deletes every key this screen does not model —
//    including values the portal owns and this app has no UI for.
//
// 2. Paired columns are written TOGETHER. The portal keeps five pairs in sync
//    (`website`/`website_url`, `bio`/`company_description`,
//    `years_experience`/`years_of_experience`, `rera_number`/`license_number`,
//    `city`/`work_city`) because different read sites prefer different halves.
//    Writing one alone makes the two platforms disagree about the same profile.
//
// 3. Four columns are OMITTED entirely: `user_type`, `user_role`, `is_blocked`,
//    `approval_status`. The `can_update_profile_fields()` BEFORE UPDATE trigger
//    silently reverts them for a non-admin owner — it does not raise — so sending
//    them produces a save that reports success and changes nothing.
