// models/profile_review.dart
//
// Ratings a profile has received: one review row, plus the aggregate the Reviews
// section renders.
//
// WHY THE AGGREGATE IS MODELLED HERE AND NOT FETCHED TWICE
// -------------------------------------------------------
// The portal makes two passes over `user_ratings`: `useUserRatings` computes the
// customer / broker / total averages, and `UserProfile.fetchUserReviews` fetches
// the five most recent rows that carry review text. The rating *distribution* the
// redesigned screen shows (5 bars, 5★ down to 1★) needs per-star counts, which
// neither pass produces.
//
// All three are folds over the same rows, so `ProfileContentService` fetches the
// rating rows once and [RatingBreakdown.fromRatings] derives everything. No extra
// round-trip, and no new query beyond the one the portal already issues.
//
// `RatingsService.getRatingSummary` is untouched and remains the own-profile
// path. It cannot be reused here: it returns only (count, average) and adding a
// method to it would modify an existing service, which the approved rules
// forbid. The averaging arithmetic below is deliberately identical to it —
// 1 decimal place via `toStringAsFixed(1)` — so the same profile never shows a
// different number on the two screens.
