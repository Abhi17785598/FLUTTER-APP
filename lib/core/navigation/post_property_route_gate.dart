// core/navigation/post_property_route_gate.dart
//
// Role gates for the three content-creation wizards, at the route rather than in
// the components that link to them.
//
// WHY CENTRALLY
// -------------
// An audit found **eleven** places that navigate to `/post-property`. Six were
// reachable by a builder with no role check at all, and three of those are shared,
// role-blind components:
//
//   * `BottomNavBar`'s centre "+" button — no role awareness anywhere in that
//     file, and it appears on thirteen screens including the builder's own
//     dashboard;
//   * Home's "Post Property" quick action — a `static const` tile;
//   * the Profile screen's "Add Property" tile in both Create Content and My
//     Content — the screen computes `isBuilder` but uses it only for a different
//     control.
//
// Making each of those role-aware would mean threading `AuthProvider` through
// three shared widgets and keeping them in step forever. Both wizards funnel
// through `onGenerateRoute`, so one gate per route covers every caller including
// the voice agent, which reaches them by path.
//
// ALL THREE GATES LIVE HERE
// -------------------------
// They are three faces of one rule — `permissions.dart`'s `canCreate`, which
// already says `property → userType != 'builder'`, `project → userType ==
// 'builder'` and `video → userType == 'influencer'`. Splitting them across files
// would let one drift.
//
// WHAT IS NOT GATED
// -----------------
// Edit mode, ever. Reopening an existing row is not creating one, and a builder
// with legacy `properties` rows must be able to edit them — `MyListingsSection`
// depends on it. Note the edit callers construct `PostPropertyScreen` directly
// through a `MaterialPageRoute` and never touch this route, so the edit branch
// below is a guard for a future caller rather than a live path.
