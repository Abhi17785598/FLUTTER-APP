// config/launch_features.dart
//
// Compile-time launch feature flags. Every payment-taking, subscription,
// paid-collaboration and Meta-publishing surface in this app is gated by one
// of these three booleans — none of their implementation (screens,
// providers, services, models, Razorpay, Meta OAuth) is deleted; only their
// entry points, automatic prompts, notification handling and optional data
// loading are gated, all reversibly.
//
// FAIL CLOSED, ON PURPOSE
// ------------------------
// Every flag has `defaultValue: false`. A build that forgets to pass
// `--dart-define-from-file` — including a plain `flutter run` — gets every
// gated feature HIDDEN, never silently enabled. To turn a feature back on,
// build with the matching JSON file:
//
//   flutter build appbundle --release \
//     --dart-define-from-file=config/features/play_release.json   # all off — Play launch
//   flutter run \
//     --dart-define-from-file=config/features/full_development.json # all on — local/dev
//
// Neither JSON file holds a secret — they are three booleans each, safe to
// commit.
