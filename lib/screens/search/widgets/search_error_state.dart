/// treatment: that widget already renders exactly this composition — a soft
/// primary-tinted circle behind an icon, a bold title, a muted message and a
/// solid primary action carrying `primaryActionShadow` — to the redesign's spec,
/// and it is used by several other surfaces. Reused as-is, not modified.

/// Wrapped in a scroll view here rather than at each call site so the state
/// cannot overflow on a short viewport. That is not hypothetical: the sibling
/// empty state overflowed by 17 px once the AI confirmation strip took height
/// above it, and this content is taller.
