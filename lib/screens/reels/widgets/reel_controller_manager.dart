/// Manages [VideoPlayerController] lifecycle for the reels feed.
///
/// Why a dedicated manager instead of one controller per page widget?
///   • TikTok/Instagram-style feeds must PRELOAD the neighbouring videos so a
///     swipe starts playing instantly instead of showing a spinner.
///   • Controllers are expensive (native decoders, buffers). We therefore keep
///     a small sliding window of controllers alive (previous, current, next)
///     and dispose everything outside it — bounding memory use regardless of
///     feed length.
///   • Centralising lifecycle here removes the per-page init/dispose races that
///     caused the old screen's flicker and "wrong video playing" glitches.
///
/// [ReelControllerManager] is a [ChangeNotifier]: it notifies whenever a
/// controller's readiness changes (becomes initialized, fails, or times out).
/// The screen listens to this via `AnimatedBuilder` so the UI rebuilds at the
/// exact moment a controller is ready — this is what makes the first reel
/// actually appear instead of being frozen on its pre-init placeholder.

  /// where a decoder that reports a non-standard stride or colour format shows
  /// up as green diagonal tearing, and it is device-specific because the stride
  /// comes from the vendor's driver.
  ///
  /// `platformView` calls `exoPlayer.setVideoSurfaceView(surfaceView)`
  /// (`PlatformVideoView.java:49`), handing frames straight to SurfaceFlinger.
  /// No Flutter texture, no sampling, no stride to get wrong.
